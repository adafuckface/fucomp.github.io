## Getting started

In theory:
```bash
make dev-env
```
should get you set up and
```bash
make serve
```
should give you a local instance which will update as you change files

## Submission Guidelines - Provisional

Fork the repository and checkout the source branch.

Commit any articles, stories, posts etc to the /_drafts folder of your personal version of the repository. When you are happy with your content submit a pull request and it will be reviewed by a member of staff. Any comments and corrections will be available to view in the PR process.
On successful submission you will be asked to move your article from /_drafts to /_posts or /_pages or wherever is deemed appropriate and your PR will be merged into the master branch. Congratulations!

### Notes

There will be no accepted PRs on the master branch.
There is no /_drafts folder in the master branch.

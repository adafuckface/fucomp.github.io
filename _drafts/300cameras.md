# 300 Cameras Per Dayâ€¦

> The average British Citizen is caught on closed circuit security cameras on average 300 times per day

I'm sure you've seen that figure more than once in articles about privacy in newspapers and online.

In this modern age of surveillance culture we shouldn't be surprised that we're each subject to state and public scrutiny, right?

There's a certain amount of what we know as 'truthiness' to the number, it's not too high to be unbelievable and it's not too low to be surprising. It's also entirely fabricated.

This is what I've managed to piece together of this oft-quoted number so far.

Back in 2010 I was doing some cursory research for a piece I wanted to submit to the Pixelache technological arts festival the following year. I didn't get accepted that year but I'm over it now. The bastards. Still, during my research I kept seeing this number quoted time and time again.
